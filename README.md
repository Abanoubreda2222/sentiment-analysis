Sentiment Analysis
The primary goal of a sentiment analysis project is to determine the sentiment (positive or negative) expressed in text data 
Goal: Predict the sentiment (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) from text data.
Use Cases: Customer reviews, social media posts, product feedback, etc.
Sentiment Distribution: Check for class imbalances (e.g., more positive reviews than negative).
Word Clouds: Create word clouds for each sentiment category to visualize common words.
Text Embeddings: Convert text into numerical vectors using techniques like TF-IDF.
Classical Models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or SVM for a quick baseline.
